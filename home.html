      <p class="border">The advent of the internet age has transformed our daily lives. A future that we envision is one where equal opportunities are available to all people. Where everyone has a chance to earn a decent living and access an education and other opportunities. There would be thriving public services and a society which works for all people no matter their background. We get there by preventing anti-competitive business practices and stopping the accumulation of power at the hands of a few tech monoliths. We offer more protections for human rights and have common sense regulations that protect the common people while not stifling entrepreneurs, protect and educate the public regarding mass data collection and government surveillance, and ensure companies are transparent about their data collection and moderation policies.
