      <p class="issuesBorder">Expanding privacy protections to people online from corporate surveillance and state surveillance. 
          <br> A thorough reevaluation of the effectiveness and negative consequences behind ever reaching surveillance in the name of “national security”. 
          <br> Protecting Individual liberty will be given a greater priority while balancing issues of national security against human rights.  Data tracking is at the heart of many of the privacy issues facing the digital world. What the real issue that underpins it is centralization. Institutions both government and private that have massive resources to collect and analyze data 
          <br> on a scale that's difficult to imagine become very powerful and the risk for misuse increases.</p>

      <p class="issuesBorder2">The ability for people of all walks of life and social classes to express themselves and participate in both national and global culture has never been greater. <br>This amazing phenomena has been shadowed by issues of censorship and control of the platforms that offer these cultural centers. <br>With such a wide reach, it is important we are able to provide and subsequently regulate. <br>Though the solution to this is not easy or straightforward, as regulation can have powerful unanticipated tertiary effects. <br>Yet the ability for a small group of tech companies to control the platform and moderation for most of the globe's discussion <br>with little oversight or transparency is only becoming a more important problem. <br>The different goals of the different stakeholders should be taken into account in forming a policy that enables privacy and human rights<br> protection while minimizing the impact on the business environment. </p>
     
      <p class="issuesBorder3">Citizens should have better knowledge and control over the usage of their data on web services. Companies should have clear data policies that outline how they use it and if it's shared. Having adequate knowledge of what data is collected and how it is used will be key to fostering trust between individuals and tech companies. Ideally an environment where companies can still prosper using the data based business model can be achieved while also following privacy standards and ensuring user data doesn’t get into the wrong hands. Setting a standard practice for notifications of data leaks to promote improved security practices. Today there is no standard for how to handle data leaks with some companies never acknowledging them occurring and others not notifying customers until weeks or months after they occur. Allowing customers to know when their data is leaked and how often a company has had their security compromised would allow them to make more robust choices of what services they use. </p>
